#         Developer Note
#         --------------
#         Here the overloaded `+=` operator is exploited to perform
#         matrix multiplication for the directors, which is counter-
#         intutive at first. While this provides a stable interface
#         to interact the rod states with the timesteppers and the
#         rest of the world, the reasons behind including it here also has
#         a depper mathematical significance.
#
#         Firstly, position lies in the vector space corresponding to R^{3}
#         and update is done this space (with the + and * operators defined
#         as usual), hence the `+=` operator (or `__iadd__`) is reflected
#         as `+=` operator in the position update (line 163 above).
#
#         For directors rather, which lie in a restricteed R^{3} \otimes
#         R^{3} tensorial space, the space with Q^T.Q = Q.Q^T = I, the +
#         operator can be thought of as an equivalent `*=` update for a
#         'exponential' multiplication with a rotation matrix (e^{At}).
#         . This does not correspond to the position update. However, if
#         we view this in a logarithmic space the `*=` becomse the '+='
#         operator once again! After performing this `+=` operation, we
#         bring it back into its original space using the exponential
#         operator. So we are still indirectly doing the '+='
#         update.
#
#         To avoid all this hassle with the operators and spaces, we simply define
#         '+=' or '__iadd__' in the case of directors as an equivalent
#         '*=' (matrix multiply) with the RHS below.

#
#         Q : Why do we need to overload operators here?
#
#         The Derivative class naturally doesn't have a `mul` overloaded
#         operator. That means if this method is not present,
#         doing something like
#         ```
#         ds = _DerivativeState(...)
#         new_state = 2 * ds
#         ```
#         will throw an error. Note that you can do something like
#         ```
#         ds = _DerivativeState(...)
#         new_state = 2 * ds.rate_collection
#         ```
#         but this is hacky, as we are exposing the members outside,
#         in the calling scope (defeats encapsulation and hiding).
#         The point of having this class is that it works
#         well with the time-stepper (where we only use `+` and `*`
#         operations on the State/DerivativeState like above,
#         i.e. `state = dt * derivative_state`  and not something like
#         `state = dt * derivative_state.rate_collection`).
